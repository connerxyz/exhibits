# Codex

Codex is an app for building and exploring personal knowledge graphs using digital artifacts, like text, images, and video.
What its inventor, Iian Neil, calls a knowledge worker's operating system. Here's how we went about discovering a brand and visual identity for Codex.

<!-- ## A potential standout among the crowd

Iian and I had both been active in knowledge management for many years before we met. Iian for example developed a
WYSIWYG text-editor that used a novel [standoff markup](https://tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/SO/sow06.html) format designed to [work well with graph databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_markup#Graph-based_formalisms). He had begun to mature this work into something he was tweeting about called Codex, which is how we first connected. 

Personal knowledge management (PKM) tools like Notion, Roam, and Obsidian were becoming very popular at the time. But Iian and I felt there was still something missing from the markplace, and that perhaps Codex had something to offer among the crowd.

By 2020, Iian had a working application delivering two things that stood out. First, a rich text-editor
that made annotation using a graph-based standoff scheme easy. Second, a desktop-like interface users could develop into immersive environments, save as context "snapshots", and then quickly "snap" between across their work.

## Mood

A mood board helps identify a visual direction and discover potential brand elements. Codex
delivers [aha moments](https://productled.com/blog/how-to-identify-your-products-aha-moment/) to users by connecting
the new and old in surprising ways – what's old is new again. I leaned into this, mixing classical and contemporary to
find a distinctive vibe.

## Color

A variety of potential color palettes were sampled from the mood board. Gold was selected as a primary brand color
to serve a dual purpose. Gold is both old and timeless and, as a neutral color, it left room for the many other
secondary and tertiary colors Codex needed to render its user-interface.

## Typography

Again, we mix a sense of old and new. A serif for titles provides a classic and self-assured feel of physical print, while a complimentary sans-serif for body text keeps it clean and contemporary.

## Marketing, pulling it all together

A visual identity makes it easy to build a consistent brand impressions. Here is Codex's new visual identity applied to a product landing page for example.

<!--## Roadmap

Lastly, we modeled the user-experience concepts and how the application might work to support personal knowledge
management, multi-player, and facilitate marketplace exchange of texts and annotation sets.

Talk about "community governance" as a key word.
