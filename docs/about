A media and technology firm created and led by Conner Carl Mingesz Cowling.

I'm Conner ðŸ‘‹ â€“ CXYZ

&lt;!-- Personality --&gt;
I'm a multimedia creator, father, husband... But first I was a relentlessly curious, trouble making kid
from the American midwest. It wasn't until later that I learned to direct my energy and began leverage
technology to reach out across the world that I began to make at least some sense of it all.

&lt;!-- Qualifications and experience --&gt;
After pursuing an early visual art education, I went on to become an entrepreneur at 19. First freelancing graphic
design work, then running a successful retail electronics
business by 21, before going on to study computer science where I discovered an interest in large data, machine
learning, the web and a passion for the communities and experiences that could be created using these things.

- Research and development organizations.
- Focusing on unlocking creativity by building community and greater social ties, surfacing innovations created
within particular business-case driven development to get
- Running communications campaigns to push for more mature machine-learning practices beyond just the organizations'
research and development groups.
- I've been able to to work on... projects associated with millions of dollars in new revenue.

- I've more recently gotten involved with

&lt;!-- Philosophy and vision --&gt;

At a fundamental level, the fact that *anything exists* at all continues to be deeply profound to me. It's a source
endless gratitude that continues to drive me to create, experiment, and pursue ideas as far as possible. It
all comes down to committing to the work and relationships that energize you.

*This site and all the work it exhibits were produced by myself and various collaborators across the globe.
